# LoanPrediction-ML
My first ML project/Classifier.

Built a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not.

Loaded a historical dataset from previous loan applications, cleaned the data, and applied different classification algorithm on the data.

* k-Nearest Neighbour
* Decision Tree
* Support Vector Machine
* Logistic Regression

The test results of the algorithms are evaluated using:

* Jaccard index
* F1-score
* LogLoss
